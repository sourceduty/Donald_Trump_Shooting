On July 13, 2024, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooter, a 20-year-old man, fired multiple rounds from an AR-15–style rifle, striking Trump in the upper right ear. The attack also resulted in the death of one audience member and left two others critically injured. The gunman was killed by Secret Service agents. Trump was treated and released from the hospital the same day and resumed public appearances shortly after.

The incident has led to significant criticism of the Secret Service and calls for increased security for political candidates, especially in the heated environment leading up to the 2024 presidential election. An independent review of the security arrangements has been ordered by President Biden​.

The gunman, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, accessed the roof of a building near the rally by sneaking past minimal security measures in the area. The specific details about how he managed to get onto the roof, including whether he had prior knowledge or assistance, have not been fully disclosed. The incident has sparked criticism of the security arrangements and led to an independent review ordered by President Biden.

### Security Problem

The rising threats against presidential candidates have necessitated increased security measures by the Secret Service. As the political climate grows more polarized, candidates face a heightened risk of violence, prompting the Secret Service to bolster their protective efforts. These measures include expanding the security details assigned to each candidate, enhancing surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities, and increasing coordination with local law enforcement agencies during campaign events. The growing prevalence of online threats and the possibility of coordinated attacks have also led to the use of more sophisticated technology to monitor potential dangers, ensuring the safety of candidates in various public and private settings.

However, these enhanced security measures come with significant challenges for the Secret Service. The agency must balance the need for protection with the candidates' ability to connect with voters, as too much security can create barriers between candidates and the public. Additionally, the financial and logistical demands of providing comprehensive security for an increasing number of candidates strain the agency's resources. The Secret Service is tasked with the difficult job of adapting to an evolving threat landscape while maintaining the operational flexibility required to protect candidates effectively without undermining the democratic process.

Alex: "Those who are approved to operate firearms should be integrated into a national military system and forced to homor the country they live in."
